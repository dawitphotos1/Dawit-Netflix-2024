* Template Literal Issue: When using template literals inside a string, you should use backticks (`) instead of single or double quotes.
*Initial State for isLoading:to ensure the loading state is handled correctly, itâ€™s usually best to set isLoading to true at the beginning of your useEffect and then set it to false once data fetching is completed or if an error occurs.
